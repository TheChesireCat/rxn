## 🎯 Issues Fixed in This Session

### 1. **Major Bug Fix: Player Color Mismatch** 🎨

#### Problem Diagnosed:
- **Different players had the same color orbs** despite being assigned different colors
- **Root Cause**: Two separate color systems working independently:
  1. Room Join API assigned colors from one array when players joined
  2. AnimatedCell component used a different array + hash calculation, ignoring assigned colors

#### Technical Details:
```javascript
// ❌ Room Join API used these colors:
const PLAYER_COLORS = ['#FF6B6B', '#4ECDC4', '#45B7D1', ...];

// ❌ AnimatedCell calculated different colors:
const hash = ((hash << 5) - hash + ownerId.charCodeAt(i)) & 0xffffffff;
const playerColor = DIFFERENT_COLORS[Math.abs(hash) % DIFFERENT_COLORS.length];
```

#### Solution Implemented:
- **Created shared color constants** in `/src/lib/constants.ts`
- **Updated AnimatedCell** to use actual assigned player colors
- **Modified GameBoard** to pass player information correctly
- **Eliminated hash-based color calculation**

#### Files Modified:
1. **`/src/lib/constants.ts`** (NEW) - Unified color definitions
2. **`/src/app/api/room/join/route.ts`** - Use shared constants
3. **`/src/lib/gameLogic.ts`** - Removed duplicate colors
4. **`/src/components/AnimatedCell.tsx`** - Use actual assigned colors
5. **`/src/components/GameBoard.tsx`** - Pass players array

---

### 2. **Game Title Update** 📝

#### Change Made:
- **Homepage title** changed from "Live Chain Reaction" to "Chain Reaction"
- Simple but important branding update

#### Files Modified:
- **`/src/components/HomePage.tsx`** - Updated main heading

---

### 3. **Critical Bug Fix: Room Join by Name** 🔑

#### Problem Diagnosed:
- **Users couldn't join rooms by name** - got "Room not found" error
- **Worked by Room ID but not Room Name**
- **Root Cause**: API only searched by `room.id`, never `room.name`

#### Technical Issue:
```javascript
// ❌ Only searched by ID
const roomQuery = await db.query({
  rooms: { $: { where: { id: body.roomId } } }
});
```

#### Solution Implemented:
```javascript
// ✅ Try ID first, then name if not found
let roomQuery = await db.query({
  rooms: { $: { where: { id: body.roomId } } }
});

let room = roomQuery.rooms[0];

// If not found by ID, try searching by name
if (!room) {
  roomQuery = await db.query({
    rooms: { $: { where: { name: body.roomId } } }
  });
  room = roomQuery.rooms[0];
}
```

#### Additional Fix:
- **Fixed database transaction bug** where room name was used instead of room UUID
- **Ensured all database operations use actual room ID**

#### Files Modified:
- **`/src/app/api/room/join/route.ts`** - Dual lookup + transaction fix

## 🔧 Technical Improvements Made

### Color System Architecture:
- **Single Source of Truth**: All colors now defined in `/src/lib/constants.ts`
- **Consistent Assignment**: Room join assigns colors, UI renders exact same colors
- **No Hash Calculations**: Direct lookup from players array
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation for missing players

### Room Join Robustness:
- **Flexible Input**: Users can join with either room name or room ID
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback when room doesn't exist
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing room ID sharing still works
- **Performance**: Tries ID first (more likely unique), then name

---

## 🧪 Testing Completed

### Player Color Test:
✅ **Multiple players now have distinct colors**  
✅ **Colors remain consistent throughout game**  
✅ **No more color confusion between players**  

### Room Join Test:
✅ **Join by Room Name**: "My Game" → Works  
✅ **Join by Room ID**: "f7f9c509-..." → Works  
✅ **Invalid Input**: "Non-Existent" → Proper error  

### Game Title Test:
✅ **Homepage displays "Chain Reaction"**  
✅ **Styling and animations preserved**

1. **`/src/lib/constants.ts`** - Shared game constants and colors

### Files Modified:
1. **`/src/app/api/room/join/route.ts`** - Dual room lookup + transaction fix
2. **`/src/components/HomePage.tsx`** - Title change
