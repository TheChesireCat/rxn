- **Chain Reactions** - Strategic explosions that capture territory  
- **Multiple Grid Sizes** - 3×3 to 15×15 customizable boards
- **Spectator Mode** - Watch games without participating
- **Chat System** - In-game communication
- **Mobile Responsive** - Perfect on all devices
- **Optimistic Updates** - Instant, lag-free gameplay
- **Room Management** - Create, join, and host game rooms

## 🎯 Game Mechanics Deep Dive

### Critical Mass System
- **Corner Cells**: 2 orbs = explosion
- **Edge Cells**: 3 orbs = explosion  
- **Center Cells**: 4 orbs = explosion

### Chain Reactions
1. Player places orb in cell
2. If cell reaches critical mass → explosion
3. Orbs spread to adjacent cells (not diagonal)
4. Adjacent cells become player's color
5. If adjacent cells reach critical mass → chain continues
6. Process repeats until no more explosions

### Victory Conditions
- **Elimination**: Player loses when orb count reaches 0 (after first move)
- **Victory**: Last player with orbs wins
- **Runaway Protection**: Game auto-ends after 100+ iterations

### Game Flow
1. **Lobby Phase**: Players join, host sets settings
2. **Game Start**: Minimum 2 players required
3. **Turn-Based Play**: Players take turns placing orbs
4. **Chain Resolution**: Automatic explosion calculations
5. **Victory/Elimination**: Win conditions checked after each turn
