## 🔮 FUTURE TASKS & IMPROVEMENTS

### High Priority Tasks

#### 1. **Room ID Copy Button** 🎯
**Description**: Add a convenient copy button next to the Room ID display  
**Location**: `GameRoom.tsx`, `LobbyView.tsx`  
**Implementation**:
- Add copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Show success toast on copy
- Position near Room ID display
- Use enhanced button styling from this session

#### 2. **Game Owner Cleanup** 🗑️
**Description**: When game is over, show room owner a "Close Game" trash button  
**Location**: `VictoryMessage.tsx`, `GameControls.tsx`  
**Implementation**:
- Only show to room owner/host
- Add confirmation modal
- Clean up room from database
- Redirect all players to homepage
- Use red gradient button style

#### 3. **Game Responsiveness Optimization** ⚡
**Description**: Game feels less snappy after moves - improve animation timing  
**Current Issue**: Too many checks happening during/after move animations  
**Proposed Solution**:
- Decouple move validation from animations
- Let both players play animations smoothly first
- Run validation checks only after animations complete
- Optimize re-render cycles during chain reactions
- Consider animation queuing system

**Files to investigate**:
- `GameBoard.tsx` - Move submission logic
- `AnimatedCell.tsx` - Animation timing
- `gameLogic.ts` - Validation timing
- API routes - Response speed

#### 4. **Fun Room ID Names** 🎨
**Description**: Replace UUID room IDs with memorable, fun names (like Glitch.com style)  
**Examples**: "purple-butterfly-valley", "cosmic-pizza-party", "dancing-robot-cafe"  
**Implementation**:
- Keep UUID as actual database ID
- Add `displayName` field to rooms
- Use libraries like:
  - `unique-names-generator`
  - `friendly-words`
  - Custom word combinations
- Show fun name in UI, use UUID for routing
- Add fallback to UUID if generation fails

**Files to modify**:
- Room creation API
- Database schema
- All UI components showing room ID

#### 5. **Fix Mobile vs Desktop Grid Layout** 📱💻
**Description**: Game tiles are square on mobile but wonky/rectangular on desktop  
**Current Issue**: Inconsistent aspect ratios across devices  
**Investigation needed**:
- Check CSS Grid configuration in `GameBoard.tsx`
- Verify `aspect-square` classes are applied correctly
- Test responsive breakpoints
- Ensure consistent cell sizing algorithm

**Potential fixes**:
- Force `aspect-square` on all screen sizes
- Adjust grid gap calculations
- Fix container width constraints
- Test across different screen sizes

### Medium Priority Enhancements

#### 6. **Enhanced Game Board Animations** 🎮
- Apply new CSS classes to `AnimatedCell.tsx`
- Add critical mass pulsing effects
- Implement orb floating animations
- Chain reaction visual improvements

#### 7. **Chat System Polish** 💬
- Apply glassmorphism to chat panel
- Enhanced message bubbles
- Better emoji reaction integration
- Improved mobile chat experience

#### 8. **Victory/End Game Experience** 🏆
- Enhanced victory message with animations
- Game stats summary
- Play again functionality
- Share results feature

### Low Priority Polish

#### 9. **Sound Effects Integration** 🔊
- Move placement sounds
- Chain reaction audio
- Victory fanfare
- UI interaction sounds

#### 10. **Advanced Theming** 🎨
- Multiple color scheme options
- Seasonal themes
- Player customization
- Accessibility themes (high contrast, etc.)
