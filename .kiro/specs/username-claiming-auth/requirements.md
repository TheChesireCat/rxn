# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to claim persistent usernames that are tied to their email addresses using InstantDB's magic code authentication system. Users can claim a unique username, associate it with their email, and then login in future sessions by simply entering their username. The system will send a magic code to their associated email for secure authentication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to claim a unique username and associate it with my email address, so that I can have a persistent identity in the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a desired username THEN the system SHALL check if the username is available
2. WHEN a username is available THEN the system SHALL allow the user to enter their email address
3. WHEN a user provides their email and username THEN the system SHALL send a magic code to their email
4. WHEN a user enters the correct magic code THEN the system SHALL create the username-email association and authenticate the user
5. WHEN a username is already taken THEN the system SHALL display an error message and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want to login using just my username, so that I don't have to remember my email address each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a returning user enters their claimed username THEN the system SHALL look up the associated email address
2. WHEN a valid username is found THEN the system SHALL automatically send a magic code to the associated email
3. WHEN the user enters the correct magic code THEN the system SHALL authenticate them with their existing account
4. WHEN an invalid username is entered THEN the system SHALL display an error message
5. WHEN a user enters a username that exists but the magic code fails THEN the system SHALL allow them to retry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my username to be displayed consistently across all game sessions, so that other players can recognize me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated with a claimed username THEN the system SHALL display their username in the game interface
2. WHEN a user joins a game room THEN other players SHALL see their claimed username
3. WHEN a user sends chat messages THEN the messages SHALL be attributed to their claimed username
4. WHEN a user reconnects to a game THEN their username SHALL persist across the session

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to check if a username is available before attempting to claim it, so that I can choose an available username efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a username in the claim form THEN the system SHALL provide real-time availability feedback
2. WHEN a username is available THEN the system SHALL display a green checkmark or "Available" message
3. WHEN a username is taken THEN the system SHALL display a red X or "Taken" message
4. WHEN a username contains invalid characters THEN the system SHALL display validation errors
5. WHEN a username is too short or too long THEN the system SHALL display length requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want username claims to be stored securely and persistently, so that users don't lose their claimed usernames.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a username is successfully claimed THEN the system SHALL store the username-email mapping in the database
2. WHEN the database is queried for a username THEN the system SHALL return the associated email address
3. WHEN the database is queried for an email THEN the system SHALL return the associated username if one exists
4. WHEN a user's authentication expires THEN their username claim SHALL remain valid for future logins
5. WHEN the system restarts THEN all username claims SHALL persist and remain accessible
